				<div class="ticker-item"> The OCAD Student Union acknowledges the ancestral and traditional territories of the Mississaugas of the New Credit, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy of Six Nations, the Anishinaabe and the Huron-Wendat nations, who are the original caretakers of the land on which we stand. </div>
				<div class="ticker-item"> We give thanks to those nations who have lived on and protected this territory prior to and against colonization, and we also acknowledge and give thanks to those nations who have lived here since time immemorial on whose territory we now live. </div>
				<div class="ticker-item">  Toronto is in the ‘Dish With One Spoon Territory’. The Dish With One Spoon is a treaty between the Anishinaabe, Mississaugas and Haudenosaunee Confederacy of Six Nations that bound these nations to share the wealth of the territory and protect the land. </div>
				<div class="ticker-item"> Subsequent Indigenous Nations, Europeans and all newcomers have been invited into this treaty in the spirit of peace, friendship and respect. The OCAD Student Union is committed to building meaningful relationships with Indigenous peoples and encourages our members to attend OCAD SU presentations, exhibitions, and workshops that focus on decolonization, learning about our host nations, their laws and legal frameworks and how they apply to us. </div>
