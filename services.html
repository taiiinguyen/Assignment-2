				<div class="ticker-item"> We give thanks to those nations who have lived on and protected this territory prior to and against colonization, and we also acknowledge and give thanks to those nations who have lived here since time immemorial on whose territory we now live. </div>
				<div class="ticker-item">  Toronto is in the ‘Dish With One Spoon Territory’. The Dish With One Spoon is a treaty between the Anishinaabe, Mississaugas and Haudenosaunee Confederacy of Six Nations that bound these nations to share the wealth of the territory and protect the land. </div>
				<div class="ticker-item"> Subsequent Indigenous Nations, Europeans and all newcomers have been invited into this treaty in the spirit of peace, friendship and respect. The OCAD Student Union is committed to building meaningful relationships with Indigenous peoples and encourages our members to attend OCAD SU presentations, exhibitions, and workshops that focus on decolonization, learning about our host nations, their laws and legal frameworks and how they apply to us. </div>

			<p> During the OCAD University campus closure, OCAD Student Union will be unable to run our Student Pantry service out of 230 Richmond Street West.<br> <br> To continue to support students with food security during this time, we are providing several options for students in need. Food services are available to current OCAD University students and anyone who has attended OCAD University since September 1, 2020. Students can apply to receive a Wellness Food Box from FoodShare that contains a mix of fruit and vegetables and is suitable to feed one person for a week. To apply for a box, please fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScolg6vjLujJ0kAZrxzo12vJkRGwbIn0weP21VDM3vwOw6wBA/viewform">Wellness Food Box Application Form</a>.</p> </div> 


			<div class="Service1Body_2"> <p> Students who live outside the delivery zone for the Wellness Food Box or who have other grocery-related needs that cannot be met by the food box may request a Grocery Gift Card.
