	<h2>Student Pantry</h2>
	<br>
		<p> During the OCAD University campus closure, OCAD Student Union will be unable to run our Student Pantry service out of 230 Richmond Street West.<br> <br> To continue to support students with food security during this time, we are providing several options for students in need. Food services are available to current OCAD University students and anyone who has attended OCAD University since September 1, 2020. Students can apply to receive a Wellness Food Box from FoodShare that contains a mix of fruit and vegetables and is suitable to feed one person for a week. To apply for a box, please fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScolg6vjLujJ0kAZrxzo12vJkRGwbIn0weP21VDM3vwOw6wBA/viewform">Wellness Food Box Application Form.</a> <br> <br> Students who live outside the delivery zone for the Wellness Food Box or who have other grocery-related needs that cannot be met by the food box may request a Grocery Gift Card. Gift cards can be used to purchase food as well as personal care, menstrual hygiene, and sexual health products.

	<h2>Emergency Fund</h2>
	<br>
		<p>Throughout the COVID-19 closure of OCAD University, the Student Union is offering an Emergency Support Fund for Black and Indigenous OCAD U Students. The fund was created to provide additional support for Black and Indigenous students, by offsetting the cost of expenses including, but not limited to: rent, groceries, transportation, and medical prescriptions. <br> <br> Funding is available to Black and/or Indigenous students who either currently attend OCAD University or have attended OCAD University at any point since September 1, 2020. We are able to distribute an amount of $100 per person, per month. <br> <br> Applications are processed on a first-come-first-served basis. You may access the program as needed, but you must reapply for funds each month, and we ask you to self-assess whether to apply based on need. <br> <br> To request funds from the COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund for Black and Indigenous OCAD U Students, please submit the form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAK6NcCfD7crpx6vsncVs5AO_AG8RBat1csGB-h8FpR0XZ_Q/viewform"> COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund for Black and Indigenous OCAD U Students </a> </p>

	<h2>Micro-Grants</h2>
	<br>	
		<p> Student members or groups can apply for a Micro-Grant of up to $250 to help cover the costs of an event, project, or initiative. Projects must benefit more than one student at OCADU. <br> <br> Funding will not be granted to projects related to OCAD University’s academic plan or curriculum, including thesis exhibitions and/or publications or personal travel costs. The Student Union is not able to fund selective academic work. This is a conversation you can have with your department about necessary funds and resources integral for your academic success. Funding will also not be allocated for items remaining in sole property of an individual or to cover the cost of special occasion permits or alcohol. Leftover materials purchased with the grant money and/or unused funds from the grant must be returned to the Student Union. All projects must comply with the OCAD Student Union Mandate and Safe(r) Space Policy, AODA standards (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act) and OCAD University Administrative Policies. <br> <br> Micro-grants are available on an ongoing basis throughout the academic year while funding lasts. Applications for funding are assessed by the OCAD Student Union Executive Committee. You can expect your results within approximately two weeks of when the application was submitted. <br> <br> If this is your first time applying for a Student Union Micro-Grant, or you require additional assistance, accommodations or clarification regarding the grants, or the granting process, please get in touch with Moksha Khanna, Director of Operations at <a href="mailto:operations@ocadsu.org">operations@ocadsu.org.</a> <br> <br> <b> How to Apply </b> <br> <br> If you are interested in applying for a Micro-Grant for a project that will take place between September 1, 2021 and August 31, 2022, please submit a form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGFTnHEzokpX2Czn8a4aFVZVE1arLiHzM1krMH0axrPvnzVA/viewform">here.</a> <br> <br> <b> IMPORTANT NOTE: </b> Applicants must follow all COVID-19 public health measures, advice, and restrictions in place at the time of the project.</p>

	<h2>Project Grants</h2>
	<br>
		<p> The OCAD Student Union believes the ideas and dreams of students should not be limited to the size of their wallets. OCAD SU Project Grants provide an opportunity for student members and groups to receive partial or full funding to realize projects, host events or do other creative initiatives that would otherwise be unattainable due to financial barriers. Activities that benefit the OCAD University student community may be awarded grant funding. <br><br> <b> IMPORTANT NOTE </b> <br> <br> Applicants must follow all COVID-19 public health measures, advice, and restrictions in place at the time of the project. <br> <br> For more information about the OCAD Student Union Project Grants, please see our <a href="http://ocadsu.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-22-Project-Grants-Information-Package.pdf"> 2021/22 Project Grants Information Package.</a> <br> <br> Our proposal process is paperless.
